    "answer": "On the first day, Craig made 40 pizzas\nHeather made four times as many pizzas as Craig, so she made 4 * 40 = 160 pizzas on the first day.\nOn the second day, Craig made 60 more pizzas than on the first day, so he made 40 + 60 = 100 pizzas.\nHeather made 20 fewer pizzas than Craig's number, so she made 100 - 20 = 80 pizzas on the second day.\nIn total, Craig made 40 + 100 = 140 pizzas in the two days.\nAnd Heather made 160 + 80 = 240 pizzas in the two days.\nTherefore, the two made 140 + 240 = 380 pizzas together in the two days.\n#### 380\nThe answer is \\boxed{380}",
